# Monkey-Neural-Data
N.B. This project is finished.

# Description
This is a collection of various Python assignments from a co-graduate course on "Neural Signal Processing" (EC ENGR C143A/C243A @ UCLA). Various machine learning and data science techniques, such as linear regression, discriminant analysis and data classification are utilized to properly plot, analyse and classify neural signal data. Extensively used Python libraries include matplotlib, numpy and scipy.

Throughout, I have learned various techniques and skills useful for data science and machine learning. Scripts involve plotting various graphs (e.g. histograms, spike trains, etc.), as well as manipulating the data to draw comparisons between certain factors (e.g. do Poisson processes show that the Fano factor of the data is approximately one). In addition, I have learned how to code and plot decision boundaries which can separate data points through discriminant analysis techniques, as well as take a set of training data and have a model be able to classify test data with it. Within, both the Python raw code and Jupyter Notebooks are provided. N.B. I have not uploaded the neural signal data files, some of which is non-simulated and proprietary. 

Projects:
- Homework_2: Plotting tuning curves
- Homework_3: Plotting/Manipulating neural signal data (e.g. Linear Regression)
- Homework_4: Classifying neural data
- Homework_5: Basic regression
